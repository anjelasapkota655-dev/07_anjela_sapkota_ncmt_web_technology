Website development process
Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase.
   A sitemap is a simple layout that shows all the pages of a website and their links. In the planning phase, it helps to organize the website structure 
and makes navigation easy.

2. What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
   The lunch phase is when the website is made live for anyone to use.its main purpose is to check that everything works correctly and also users can easily
access the website

3.What is "Documentation" important in the development lifecycle?
 The written record of how a website is made and works.Documentation is important because it helps developers,and users to undersatnd the system,fix problems 
and also make changes easily in the future.

4.Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
  the differtiate between Front-end and Back-end development are as follows:
Front-end                                                                   	Back-end
Deals with what users see on the website (design, layout, buttons).         	Deals with what happens behind the scenes (server, database, logic).
Uses languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript.	                                  Uses languages like PHP, Python, Java.
Focuses on user experience and interaction.                                    Focuses on storing, retrieving, and managing data.

Group B: Long Question (4 Marks)
5."Planning is the most critical phase of web development." Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
  Planning is the important phase because it sets the direction for the whole website .if this phasw is done carefully, the websites will be easier to develop 
and will meet the user's needs.
In the planning phase, the first step is requirement analysis, where developers understand what the website should do and what users need. Next, a sitemap is
created to list all the pages and show how they are connected. Then, a wireframe is designed, which is a rough layout of the website showing where content and 
features will go. After that, the technology is selected, including the right tools, platforms, and programming languages. Finally, a timeline and resources are
planned to manage the time, cost, and people needed for the project. Doing all these activities carefully ensures the website is built efficiently and works as
expected.

6.Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase.Why is a website never truly "finished"?
   The maintenance  phase is iterative because it does not happen only ince it repeats again and again.After a website is launched,users start using it and giving
feedback.Based on the feedback,small changes ,fixes, and improvements are made regulaely.Errors may appear over time so bugs need to be fixed. New content is also 
added, and old information is updated to keep the website useful.
A website is truly"finished "because  user needs,technology,and security requirements keep changing.To stay updated,safe,and user friendly ,continuous maintenance is
always required.

7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audi
ence crucial during this step?
Information gathering is the stage where we try to fully understand what the website is actually needed for. In this step, we collect details like the main purpose of
the website, what kind of information it should show, and what features it should have. We also look at similar websites to get a better idea before starting the work.
Understanding the target audience is very important because a website is made for people, not just for display. When we know who will use the website, we can decide the
right design, language, and features. This helps make the website easy to use and more effective for users.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining
the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase
 Skipping the testing phase just to save money or launch early may look tempting, but it often leads to bigger problems later. If a website is not properly tested, users may
face errors, slow loading, or broken features. This creates a bad first impression and makes users lose trust in the website.
Testing helps find mistakes before real users see them. Fixing problems after the website is live usually costs more time and money than fixing them earlier. A well-tested
website runs smoothly, feels professional, and keeps users satisfied. Therefore, testing is an important phase that should not be ignored for long-term success.

9.. Adeveloper begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze
a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze
what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
  The main problem here is that the developer rushed into coding without proper planning. Since no sitemap or design prototype was made, the client did not get a clear idea of how 
the website would look. Because of this, both the developer and the client had different expectations, and the client rejected the layout in the middle of the work.
This could have been avoided by first preparing a sitemap and a simple design prototype. These would help the client understand the structure and layout of the website before coding
starts preventing confusion and saving time and effort.

10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development
lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.
   The phase that was neglected is the Maintenance phase. Even though the website was launched successfully, it was not properly updated afterward. Because exam schedules were outdated, 
students lost interest and stopped visiting the website.
The maintenance phase involves regularly updating content, fixing errors, and checking that all information is accurate. It also includes improving performance, updating security, and
making small changes based on user needs. Regular maintenance keeps the website useful, reliable, and trusted by users.
